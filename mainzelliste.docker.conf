# Template properties for mainzelliste
#
# The configuration listed here provides default values which should be suitable for
# a variety of szenarios. At least, the sections "Database setup" and "xDAT servers"
# should be adjusted to the local environment.

# General format: Key-value pairs, separated by spaces, tabs, "=", ":".
# Lines starting with "#" are comments. Comments appended to a line are not possible!
# See Javadoc for java.util.Properties#load(Reader) for details.

# Property names may contain letters, numbers, underscores and dots. Dots define a hierarchical
# structure on the property names.

# Leading and trailing whitespaces in property values are not allowed and will be removed
# after loading.

# For a comprehensive documentation of configuration parameters see the configuration manual
# ("Konfigurationshandbuch").

# debug mode: If set to true, token handling is disabled (i.e. no tokens are necessary).

# Logging
#
# By default, logs are written to stdout. Uncomment the following values to log to a file
# instead.

#log.filename = /var/log/tomcat6/mainzelliste.log
#log.level = DEBUG

# GCP Features
#
# Institutions in heavily regulated invironments, for example CROs or other facilities
# working in the field of clinical trials, have to fulfill restrictive requirements
# in terms of logging and comprehensibility whenever data is created, modified or simply viewed.
# (WHO Guidlines for GCP, ICH GCP E6 and others)
# A so-called audit trail is a common feature implemented by systems used to access or modify this
# kind of data.
# It typically stores timestamp, user/system identifier, record name, old value, new value, reason for change and the action taken.
#
# This property activates the mainzelliste audit trail feature which creates a new table in the database
# for storing those records. It further extends the token format to include audit trail information in the 'data' field:
#
# auditTrail: {
#   username: "foo_user",
#   remoteSystem: "bar_system",
#   reasonForChange: "reason"
# }
#
# PLEASE NOTE:
# When this option is active, requests to the system without a valid audit trail object
# inside the access token will be denied.

gcp.audittrail = false

# Field definitions
#
# Every input field must be defined here with field.{fieldname}.type = {fieldtype},
# where fieldname is a unique identifier and fieldtype the name of a subclass of Field.
# Input data from the field will be stored in objects of that class.
#
# Every field defined here must either be contained in the input form
# WEB-INF/jsp/patientFormElements.jsp (with corresponding "name"-Tag) or
# be provided in the createPatient Token

# In order to deactivate fields temporarily, it is sufficient to comment out the field definition.

# Date validation:
# validator.date.{i}.fields defines a list of fields, separated by commas.
# The date string is formed by concatenation of these fields.
# validator.date.{i}.format: A format definition (see java.text.SimpleDateFormat) by
# which the date string is interpreted. Validation checks if the parsed date is valid.
# Set fields which form the date and the format (when concatenating the fields).
# Multiple dates can be specified by supplying multiple definitions with consecutive

# Exchange groups
#
# An exchange group denotes a set of fields whose values are considered interchangeable.
# The matcher (currently only EpilinkMatcher) compares the fields in each exchange group to
# all of its permutations and uses the best matching combination for final decision.
#
# An exchange group is defined by exchangeGroup.{id} = {fieldlist}, where id is a sequential number
# and fieldlist a comma-separated list of field names
exchangeGroup.0 = firstName, lastName, birthName

# Field transformations
#
# Transformations for a field {fieldname} are defined by
# field.{fieldname}.transformers = {transformerlist}, where
# transformerlist is a comma-separated list of names of subclasses of FieldTransformer.
#
# The first transformer in the list is applied to the input field as defined in the field definition;
# i.e. the type parameter IN of the first transformer must match the class of the field.
# Every subsequent transformer is applied to the output of its predecessor; i.e. its type parameter IN
# must match type parameter OUT of the preceding transformer.

# Use DiceField comparator instead of NGramComparator to apply EpilLink algorithm to hashed fields
# field.firstName.comparator = DiceFieldComparator

# Blocking
# The blocking strategy choice depends on the field types after the transformation.
# If compound fields are passed to the blocker, whether created by a field transformation or as input fields,
# the type of the subfields is the one that is relevant for the blocking.
# If exchange groups are used, only one of the fieldnames should be given here. The blocker is applied to
# the other fields as well.

# Use Soundex for PlainText fields
blocking.soundex.type = Soundex
# With the default exchange group
# blocking.soundex.fields = lastName
# Without an exchange group
blocking.soundex.fields = firstName, lastName, birthName

# Use FieldEquality e.g. for birthday based blocking
# This can be combined with Soundex blocking.
# blocking.dob.type = FieldEquality
# blocking.dob.fields = birthDay, birthMonth, birthYear

# FieldEquality can also be used for externally generated blocking keys
# The input field must of course be defined above.

# blocking.lsh.type = HLsh
# blocking.lsh.fields = firstName, lastName
# The lengths of the above hashed fields
# blocking.lsh.bfSize = 384, 512, 512
# The lsh method defines the strategy for multiple fields.
# Depending on the expected quality of the fields select one of the following possibilities.
# General advise:
# High values for lshKeys can reduce false negatives, but will have a negative impact on the performance.
# High values for lshHashes can improve the performance, but can lead to more false negatives.

# Recommended: Fields with missing or dirty values
# blocking.lsh.lshMethod = field
# Number of keys per field
# blocking.lsh.lshKeys = 1
# Number of hash functions per field
# blocking.lsh.lshHashes = 36

# Total number of keys
# blocking.lsh.lshKeys = 9
# Number of hash functions per field (can be used as a weight)
# blocking.lsh.lshHashes = 8, 8, 8

# The seed for the hash functions
# blocking.lsh.seed = 42

# The following options can improve the performance by reducing the size of the blocks.
# The ratio of the frequent bit positions to ignore in the blocking keys (Choose 0 to deactivate the optimization)
# blocking.lsh.pruneRatio = 0.25
# Trigger the optimization on each startup of the Mainzelliste
